        <description>Evening Briefing: Americas  

      Bloomberg Evening Briefing Americas         View in browser                          As sophisticated scams increasingly target the life savings of Americans, a more mundane effort is underway to steal from you. It’s part of a little-noticed pattern popping up all across US banking—from towers in Manhattan to hubs in Florida and even suburban Louisiana. It seems the financial industry’s lowest-paid employees keep getting caught selling sensitive customer information—your information—right out from under their boss’s noses. This kind of 20th century scamming (even fake checks are involved) is fast emerging as a critical area of weakness in bank risk controls, which is kind of ironic given the traditional (and continuing) messaging from the bank lobby. The industry has long sought to remind the public that the customers themselves (and certainly not the banks) are the ones primarily responsible for ensuring they don’t get ripped off. —David E. Rovella            What You Need to Know Today            BlackRock’s iShares unit offers more than 1,400 exchange-traded funds around the world, yet none of them have performed quite like this. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) smashed industry records in its launch this year. In just 11 months, it grew to a behemoth with more than $50 billion in assets. No ETF has ever had a better debut. One industry expert notes that its size swelled to the equivalent of the combined assets under management of more than 50 European market-focused ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of advisory firm The ETF Store, called it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Yet IBIT’s success was about more than just racking up big numbers for BlackRock. It proved to be a turning point for Bitcoin itself.                Citadel founder Ken Griffin was only half right when he said the multistrategy hedge fund boom had “come and gone.” Yes, the amount of money these multimanager funds oversee has dipped from last year—partly because some (including Citadel) have returned billions of dollars of profits to clients. But the firms, also known as “pod shops,” are actually still in their heyday—and several rank among the world’s largest hedge funds. Demand for the biggest among them is strong, performance improved this year and the war for talent to trade their billions of dollars continues to rage.                  For a crushed commercial real estate market, 2024 was actually a year of diverging fortunes. Some office landlords in the US, facing plunging valuations, struck deals to sell properties they no longer wanted—often at steep price cuts—while scoring new equity investments on high-quality towers. Overall, office sales volume for the year through November jumped 17% from the same period a year earlier. But insight can be drawn from the top deals of the year—from a stake sale in a trophy Manhattan office tower to a distressed offloading of Pacific Corporate Towers in California. With $300 billion of debt in need of refinancing in the next 12 months, landlords can use all the lessons they can get.                A Chinese state-sponsored actor hacked the US Treasury, the agency told Congress Monday, saying a third-party software service provider was used as a conduit. “On Dec. 8, 2024, Treasury was notified by a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, that a threat actor had gained access to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users,” according to the letter seen by Bloomberg News. “Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor.” The news comes just days after AT&T and Verizon acknowledged that they’d been hit by the China-linked Salt Typhoon hacking operation.                Brazilian assets finished the year lagging all major peers, with the real posting its biggest slump since the pandemic shock of 2020. The real weakened 21% against the US dollar this year, the worst among 31 major currencies alongside Argentina’s tightly controlled peso. Losses accelerated in November after a long-awaited government fiscal package failed to earn investor support. Not even a historic intervention by the central bank—spending some $20 billion in reserves in two weeks—has been able to reverse the rout. The monetary authority stepped in again on Monday, the last trading session of the year for local assets, selling about $1.8 billion in the spot market.                  The Adani Group will exit its 44% holding in consumer joint-venture Adani Wilmar and use the cash to bolster its main businesses. The sale comes amid legal challenges facing the Indian conglomerate’s indicted  billionaire founder, Gautam Adani. The US alleges he played a part in a  bribery scheme to win contracts in India. Ratings companies have cited the allegations as a potential risk to fundraising for the group. But the prosecution hasn’t just renewed scrutiny on Adani Group’s corporate governance, it’s also  made it trickier for it to tap markets, and that could lead to asset sales.                In 2006, Jimmy Carter published a best-selling book on Palestine with the word “apartheid” in the title. Then he went on a whirlwind book tour, captured on film by Jonathan Demme, to promote it. Carter spoke, signed books and calmly rebutted criticism and attacks with his trademark Sunday-school demeanor. Allies, including Nancy Pelosi, then on the verge of becoming Speaker of the House, were annoyed. Enemies were livid. As for Carter, Francis Wilkinson writes in Bloomberg Opinion, he was 82 years old and itching  for a fight that mattered.  Former US President Jimmy Carter died on Sunday at the age of 100.

The chip industry saw major successes and failures during the past year. But first...Three things you need to know today:• OpenAI is considering a corporate change to become more like a for-profit company• AT&T and Verizon say their networks are clear of the China-linked Salt Typhoon hacking operation• Nvidia supplier Ibiden weighs a faster expansion to keep up with AI demand   The best of times, the worst of times   Of the 10 public companies in the world that investors value at more than $1 trillion, a third are in the chip industry.Broadcom Inc. joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and, of course, Nvidia Corp. in that exclusive club in 2024, capping a remarkable reevaluation of what was once a sleepy corner of the technology industry. Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang traveled the world pushing everyone to start using artificial intelligence (and his hardware) while his company continued to deliver implausible growth.While the debate continues about whether AI is real or just the latest tech bubble, there has been a clear bet that the makers of the fundamental components of that technology are going to win regardless.In a year in which these three companies that used to be niche players in their own industry achieved a combined value of more than $5 trillion – bigger than Japan’s total gross domestic product — that should have been the story.But two other longtime chipmakers came close to stealing the limelight — for the opposite reasons.  The semiconductor industry has always been a brutal place. The tiny components can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and years to design and bring to market. Trying to manufacture them at scale requires facilities that cost more than $20 billion to build and equip, and those factories become obsolete in as little as five years.The economics have always made it a high-stakes game, and the increasing complexity has upped the ante to the point where it’s only a shrinking list of names that can afford to play.Arguably the two companies that understood best how to survive in this environment were Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. For decades, both dominated their respective areas with a simple formula: Invest heavily, even when demand is going through one of its all-too-frequent slumps, and move faster than the opposition to bring out new technology so when customers come flooding back, you vacuum up the bulk of lucrative surges in demand.In 2024, however, a struggling Samsung replaced the head of its chip division. Onetime also-ran SK Hynix Inc. is blowing past it in growth and taking market share, bolstered by the ability to more quickly produce the new types of memory that are central to AI computer systems. Samsung also has been falling further behind TSMC in the foundry business of manufacturing chips for other semiconductor companies. While Samsung still has time to course-correct and deliver AI-related memory in the kind of volume that’s required, faith in its once-unquestioned leadership has been undermined.

The chip industry saw major successes and failures during the past year. But first...Three things you need to know today:• OpenAI is considering a corporate change to become more like a for-profit company• AT&amp;T and Verizon say their networks are clear of the China-linked Salt Typhoon hacking operation• Nvidia supplier Ibiden weighs a faster expansion to keep up with AI demand   The best of times, the worst of times   Of the 10 public companies in the world that investors value at more than $1 trillion, a third are in the chip industry.Broadcom Inc. joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and, of course, Nvidia Corp. in that exclusive club in 2024, capping a remarkable reevaluation of what was once a sleepy corner of the technology industry. Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang traveled the world pushing everyone to start using artificial intelligence (and his hardware) while his company continued to deliver implausible growth.While the debate continues about whether AI is real or just the latest tech bubble, there has been a clear bet that the makers of the fundamental components of that technology are going to win regardless.In a year in which these three companies that used to be niche players in their own industry achieved a combined value of more than $5 trillion – bigger than Japan’s total gross domestic product — that should have been the story.But two other longtime chipmakers came close to stealing the limelight — for the opposite reasons.  The semiconductor industry has always been a brutal place. The tiny components can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and years to design and bring to market. Trying to manufacture them at scale requires facilities that cost more than $20 billion to build and equip, and those factories become obsolete in as little as five years.The economics have always made it a high-stakes game, and the increasing complexity has upped the ante to the point where it’s only a shrinking list of names that can afford to play.Arguably the two companies that understood best how to survive in this environment were Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. For decades, both dominated their respective areas with a simple formula: Invest heavily, even when demand is going through one of its all-too-frequent slumps, and move faster than the opposition to bring out new technology so when customers come flooding back, you vacuum up the bulk of lucrative surges in demand.In 2024, however, a struggling Samsung replaced the head of its chip division. Onetime also-ran SK Hynix Inc. is blowing past it in growth and taking market share, bolstered by the ability to more quickly produce the new types of memory that are central to AI computer systems. Samsung also has been falling further behind TSMC in the foundry business of manufacturing chips for other semiconductor companies. While Samsung still has time to course-correct and deliver AI-related memory in the kind of volume that’s required, faith in its once-unquestioned leadership has been undermined. The chip unit of the company gained an edge over Japanese rivals in the early 1990s with relentless investment and delivery of new products. After 30 years far in the lead, it’s now hearing footsteps close behind.That South Korean drama pales in comparison with the Intel show.

Top Stories    The US economy exceeded expectations in 2024, as household spending held up, buoyed by the labor market. But there are troubling signs ahead. Spanish  inflation quickened more than anticipated, staying above 2% for a second month on base effects and supporting the case for  gradual ECB interest-rate cuts.  China’s central government urged local authorities to  offer handouts to people struggling with the cost of living ahead of the lunar new year holiday.   Trade Headwinds   Companies around the world are scrambling to get ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on the US’s biggest trading partners in 2025.But with just three weeks left until Inauguration Day, many economists can only venture a guess as to how Trump’s trade wars will influence the growth outlook, or answer one of next year’s most pressing questions: Will central bankers keep lowering interest rates if tariffs spark new inflationary pressures?“Anything can happen — there’s even talk about possible rate hikes depending on what happens with tariffs and inflation,” BMO Capital Markets senior economist Jennifer Lee told Bloomberg TV last week. “So right now it’s like anything goes.”If Trump’s favorite word in the dictionary is “tariff,” perhaps the least favorite entry for businesses, consumers and economists is “uncertainty,” like the kind that surrounds his plan for widespread increases in import taxes.“The big thing right now is the uncertainty — what exactly is it going to hit, when is it going to hit, how is it going to hit?” Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport, said last week on Bloomberg Surveillance. Here are three drivers of the big unknowns for global trade in 2025:Tariff sheriff returns. The self-proclaimed Tariff Man returns to office on Jan. 20 and Trump has spent the weeks before the election threatening Mexico, Canada, China and the European Union with higher duties on imports unless leaders take specific action ranging from cracking down on illegal migration to buying more American energy exports.Earlier this month Bloomberg Economics laid out a plausible scenario for how Trump might deploy his tariffs starting in mid-2025, with levies on China tripling by the end of the following year. “Anyone with a trade surplus with the US should be feeling very uncomfortable right now,” Lee said.US port gridlock. Dockworkers at US East and Gulf Coast ports may walk off the job unless they can reach a new contract with their employers by the Jan. 15 deadline. (The ILA — the largest maritime workers union in North America — went on strike for three days in early October and the disruptions were immediate if short-lived.) Trump has weighed in recently, siding with ILA workers. Their employers are digging in their heels on the use of automated equipment. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro research at ING, said one possibility is “a counterintuitive surge in global trade in the first months of the year as companies frontload exports to the US.”Geopolitical turmoil. The Red Sea was the arena for Houthi shipping attacks through 2024, and with missiles still flying, ships are expected to continue diverting around South Africa heading into next year. Now comes Trump with his eye on reasserting US control of an even more important waterway for the nation’s economy — the Panama Canal. Panama’s president stood his ground. In both cases, geopolitical conflict in vital waterways is another cloud over international commerce.Big Take: A $2 Trillion Reckoning Looms as Ports Become Pawns in GeopoliticsHeading into 2025, there’s potentially good news in shipping that might actually offset the higher costs that Trump’s tariffs will create. Cargo carriers have ordered a lot of new vessels that will come on line in 2025, easing upward pressure on freight rates that are ending this year on the rise. And if the Red Sea violence subsides, allowing traffic to flow normally again, “that will instantly bring the price of ocean freight down by two-thirds, maybe more,” Petersen said.

The Best of Bloomberg Economics    Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her department is likely to begin taking special accounting maneuvers in mid-January to  avoid breaching the US debt limit, and asked lawmakers to  take action defending the “full faith and credit” of the US. China may start selling its products to Europe at  discounted rates if the US starts a trade war by imposing new tariffs, European Central Bank official Klaas Knot said. Argentina sold some  $803 million in hard-currency reserves last week after officials rushed to meet a surge in demand from importers for dollars. Turkey’s president said rates will fall in 2025. Meanhwhile, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said the country won’t undermine next year’s  inflation forecast when increasing taxes on fuel and tobacco.

      Bloomberg Morning Briefing Americas         View in browser                          Good morning. Jimmy Carter dies. The US economy surprises, again, despite election uncertainty and high interest rates. And the Mega Millions jackpot winner faces some big choices. Listen to the day’s top stories.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president who brokered peace between Israel and Egypt in the historic Camp David Accords,  has died at 100. His one-term presidency was marred by high inflation, an oil shortage and the Iran hostage crisis, but some of his most notable achievements came after he left the White House—his humanitarian work won him the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize. The former president will get a state funeral, and Joe Biden designated Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning.

Jimmy Carter's Life and Career              Watch the Video                The US economy defied expectations in 2024, outperforming G-7 peers despite the divisive election, elevated interest rates and a cooling labor market. Here are seven charts to put it into perspective. And when it comes to stocks, Wall Street strategists got it wrong again, as witnessed by the S&P 500’s 25% surge this year. Now few are calling for the rally to end.  Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018. In South Korea, investigators are focusing on a bird strike and the unusual failure of landing gear to engage in the crash of a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 jet that killed 179  people. Elsewhere, Russia shot at an Azerbaijan Airlines plane “by accident” on Dec. 25, leading to its fatal crash, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said.

      Bloomberg Morning Briefing Americas         View in browser                          Good morning. Jimmy Carter dies. The US economy surprises, again, despite election uncertainty and high interest rates. And the Mega Millions jackpot winner faces some big choices. Listen to the day’s top stories.              Markets Snapshot         S&amp;P 500 Futures     6,015.25     -0.19%         Nasdaq 100 Futures     21,662.5     -0.17%         Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index     1,301.16     -0.15%         Market data as of 06:47 am EST.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president who brokered peace between Israel and Egypt in the historic Camp David Accords,  has died at 100. His one-term presidency was marred by high inflation, an oil shortage and the Iran hostage crisis, but some of his most notable achievements came after he left the White House—his humanitarian work won him the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize. The former president will get a state funeral, and Joe Biden designated Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning.  Click here to see Carter’s life in pictures.                      Jimmy Carter&#39;s Life and Career              Watch the Video                The US economy defied expectations in 2024, outperforming G-7 peers despite the divisive election, elevated interest rates and a cooling labor market. Here are seven charts to put it into perspective. And when it comes to stocks, Wall Street strategists got it wrong again, as witnessed by the S&amp;P 500’s 25% surge this year. Now few are calling for the rally to end.  Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018. In South Korea, investigators are focusing on a bird strike and the unusual failure of landing gear to engage in the crash of a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 jet that killed 179  people. Elsewhere, Russia shot at an Azerbaijan Airlines plane “by accident” on Dec. 25, leading to its fatal crash, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said. He had a phone call with Vladimir Putin,  who apologized for the incident, although without saying whether Russia was at fault.

Five things you need to know             US equity futures edged lower as investors trimmed positions amid uncertainty heading into year-end. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both slid more than 1% at the end of last week with  tech megacaps bearing the brunt Jimmy Carter, the 39th US President, has died at the age of 100 and President Joe Biden has designated Jan. 9 as a  national day of mourning. The US stock market has traditionally closed on the day of presidential funerals. No announcement has been made as of yet by exchange overseers  Nissan shares headed for a two-day drop of 13% on concern the terms of the carmaker’s planned deal with Honda would give investors a lower stake in the proposed joint holding company. The stock fell as much as 6.7% on Monday in Tokyo  A Jeju Air jet suffered a landing-gear malfunction on Monday before returning safely to Seoul, the airline’s second aircraft to experience the fault in two days. South Korean authorities said they would probe the latest incident, which comes a day after 179 people died in the country’s  worst civil-aviation disaster The Treasury market is close to vanquishing the small gains it has made so far in 2024 as bond investors head into  another holiday-shortened trading week with few economic data releases or scheduled Federal Reserve speakers. US markets will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year’s Day holidayWhich assets will fare the best next year? Let us know and take the Markets Pulse survey.                                      Targets toppling              This time last year, the stock market’s rally had blown past even the most optimistic targets and  Wall Street forecasters were convinced it couldn’t keep up the dizzying pace.So as strategists at Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and other big firms sent out their calls for 2024, a consensus took shape: After surging more than 20% as artificial intelligence breakthroughs unleashed a tech-stock boom and the economy kept defying the doomsayers, the S&P 500 Index would likely scratch out only a modest gain. As the Federal Reserve shifted to cutting interest rates, Treasuries were seen as ripe to give equities a run for their money. What followed, instead, delivered another humbling to Wall Street prognosticators who have been caught off guard by the market’s twists and turns ever since the end of the pandemic. Rather than lose steam, equity prices continued to soar higher.By late January, the S&P 500 had already surpassed the average year-end target from strategists. It went on to hit one record high after another and is heading to a 25% gain in 2024, capping the strongest back-to-back annual runs since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.   “There is an element of miraculousness to it,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI, who by mid-year abandoned his call for a slight dip in the S&P 500 and was the first among major strategists to introduce a year-end target of 6,000. “Trends can go on longer and go farther than one could ever imagine.”Still, a normally sleepy year-end session on Friday in the US saw the S&P 500 fall as much as 1.7% on no obvious news — underscoring risks to the one equity strategy that has worked reliably in 2024. So-called momentum investing, or riding the market’s winners, has rewarded its faithful handsomely — while also raising risk that blowups like Friday’s will become more common.“Momentum is great until it’s not, until something changes,” said Melissa Brown, head of applied research at SimCorp. —  Alexandra Semenova,  Sagarika Jaisinghani and Justina Lee            On the move            Apple shares have rallied 33% this year, adding almost $870 billion in value, and propelling the iPhone maker’s market capitalization to $3.9 trillion. The stock, which reclaimed the title of the most valuable company earlier this year, has fallen in just four sessions this month. Reaching a market cap of $4 trillion would mean it’s worth more than the bottom 43% of the S&P 500 companies combined.  Elsewhere, the Bitcoin rally sparked by Donald Trump’s election victory in early November is  stalling as 2024 draws to a close. The digital asset wavered at around $93,000 on Monday morning in London, about $15,000 below the record high set in mid-December. — Subrat Patnaik             Dollar strength            The dollar is headed for its  best year in almost a decade as US economic strength reins in expectations for the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting cycle and Trump’s threats of harsh tariffs underpin bullish bets on the currency. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose more than 7% so far this year, the best run since 2015. All currencies in the developed world weakened against the greenback as other central banks had to support local economies. “The main pillar of support for the US dollar this year has been the strength of the economy,” said Skylar Montgomery Koning, a foreign-exchange strategist at Barclays. “That strength means the Fed is coalescing on a shallow cutting cycle that leaves rates in the US higher than elsewhere, helping sustain historically elevated dollar valuations.”  The dollar gauge touched the strongest level in over two years earlier this month when the Fed cut interest rates but signaled a slowdown in the pace of monetary easing. Still, as Wall Street bets the dollar has more room to rise in 2025, global economic growth may improve later in the year, supporting other currencies and weighing on the dollar. In 2024 so far, the yen, Norwegian krone and New Zealand dollar were the worst performers in the Group of 10, with each falling more than 10% against the greenback as of Dec. 27. The euro has lost about 5.5% to trade near $1.04, with a growing number of strategists seeing the risk of the common currency reaching parity with the dollar next year.  — Anya Andrianova and Carter Johnson            What else we’re reading             South Korea investigators seek  arrest warrant for President Yoon  Musk’s growing influence erodes resistance to Starlink  Gold’s 27% advance stands out in mixed year for metals markets ECB’s Knot says trade war could export China deflation to Europe Aliyev says Russia accidentally shot Azerbaijan Airlines jet  China fights rumors of panda abuse at US Zoo in sign of goodwill           Please share your thoughts on how we’re doing and what we’re missing.

        <description>The Forecast  

      A fitting summary for 2024 |         View in browser                          Welcome back to The Forecast, where we help you think about the future — from next week to next decade — with predictions and analysis.It’s the end of the year, so we’re getting some rest and hope you are too. In that spirit, today we just have an essay — one full of fodder to discuss at any New Year’s Eve party. Our usual format will return next weekend.             Bots, Bullets and Bitcoin            Throughout the year, Bloomberg Intelligence tracks a list of themes based on companies’ exposure to consumer and technology trends. Elections and macroeconomics dominated the news this year, but BI’s list highlights a few other important narratives. The top-performing theme by total returns was “modern global defense,” while AI came in third, enterprise fintech fourth and the future of finance fifth. (Second went to the futuristic catch-all “Frontier Tech.”) AI, defense and fintech — bots, bullets, Bitcoin. It’s a fitting summary of the global economy as 2024 draws to a close. Start with AI, where this year brought plenty of breakthroughs. OpenAI’s o1 model surpassed predecessors in math and science, while Anthropic, Google, X and Meta released models at or near the frontier. Chatbots are giving way to AI agents, and nearly two-thirds of companies now use generative AI. One in three working-age Americans uses it every week. Today’s AI already allows people to interact with computers in ways that until recently seemed impossible. Want to make a playlist on Spotify? AI can do it for you. Want to write a program that filters news articles from an API? No need to write code yourself. Want a recipe to create a deadly bioweapon? Well, that brings us to defense.Many of the companies in BI’s “modern defense” theme made a strategic bet that the post-Cold War order was over, and that a world without US hegemony would be more brutish (and thus require more defense spending). Palantir’s iconoclastic 2020 IPO prospectus — in which it decried the “engineering elite” of Silicon Valley for failing to understand “what justice requires” — now seems prescient. It’s been nearly three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reset geopolitics, and 14 months since Hamas’s attack on Israel, and Israel’s response, started to redraw Middle Eastern politics. And that’s only the shortlist.   Workers clear rubble at a thermal power plant in Ukraine, damaged after a Russian missile strike in April. Photographer: Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg The result is boom time for weapons makers around the world. Human ingenuity that might have gone into health care or clean energy is now going toward defense. AI, too, is being directed under this aegis, from drones to cybersecurity.Unfortunately, there is another side to the “bullets” theme. Global conflict has not, by and large, drawn citizens closer within borders. Political polarization is rising in nearly every part of the world and democracy has wobbled in places like South Korea and Romania. In July, a would-be assassin’s bullet glanced off Donald Trump; in December, one took the life of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Here again, AI could exacerbate existing tensions — reorganizing entire occupations and creating bitter fights over who has to change and how. AI should be the type of technology that makes people’s lives better. Economists generally view innovation as the main long-term contributor to living standards, as new ideas make people more productive and richer, freeing up time to innovate anew. But there is a second strand of thinking in the economic growth literature, and it holds that political institutions matter most of all. This year, the pioneers of that school, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, of MIT and the University of Chicago, won the Nobel prize in economics for their work. The trio contends that more inclusive, more democratic political institutions are the primary driver of economic growth — because they allow citizens to share in the fruits of their labor. Lately, Acemoglu and Johnson have warned that AI could centralize power and therefore lead not to prosperity but to tyranny.   The Palantir prospectus anticipated this growing gap between geopolitics on the one hand and the marvels coming out of Silicon Valley on the other. “The advance of [internet companies’] technologies has outpaced the development of the forms of political control that are capable of governing their use,” CEO Alex Karp wrote. He was right. If only there were some sort of governance technology that could operate in a low-trust world, and that had recently been unleashed from any specter of regulation…Advocates of cryptocurrency have long lauded it as a means of decentralized decision-making, but despite a banner year the technology is still teetering between the Wild West of scams and fortunes and its quiet integration into the financial system. Peter Thiel famously said, “We were promised flying cars; we got 140 characters.” With crypto we were promised DAOs and smart contracts; we got $100,000 Bitcoin.   A cartoon image of Trump holding a Bitcoin token at a Coinhero store in Hong Kong. Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg So what happens next? The smart money is usually on “muddle through,” but it’s also worth contemplating an alternative. What if governance never catches up to invention? What if AI is unleashed and never quite controlled — not in the sense of a robot takeover but, as Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain puts it, as a new form of asbestos: dangerous, everywhere and hard to get rid of. What if we simply don’t stop burning coal because energy demand is rising too fast and geopolitics prevent us from adopting cleaner alternatives? What if we don’t learn any lessons from Covid and the next pandemic is even worse? What if multiple great powers equipped with nuclear weapons and AI can’t find a way to peacefully coexist?In 2025, look out for any sign of improved governance and water those seeds if you can. Technical progress desperately needs to be matched by social progress that increases trust and delivers better decision-making — from neighborhoods to boardrooms to relations between heads of state. There is a future out there where AI makes us much more prosperous, where war abates and international cooperation resumes and where climate change is at least mitigated and managed. But looking back at the themes of 2024, it’s clear that’s not the path we are on.— Walter Frick, Bloomberg Weekend EditionBloomberg Intelligence theme rankings are year-to-date, equal-weighted percentage return.

      Broken systems and tricky trade-offs |         View in browser                          Welcome to the weekend!It’s the final weekend of 2024, and a good time to ask whether the systems that underpin the global economy are fit for purpose. To that end, we’ve pulled together a dozen of the year’s best stories, covering everything from the rise of AI to the fall of Nike’s CEO. The through line? It’s worth interrogating the narratives we craft about the trade-offs we’ll accept. That also happens to be a good New Year’s resolution. In case you missed them, here are some of 2024’s most-read stories:   What We Know About Covid’s Impact on Your Brain   Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade   If You Think World War III Is Unimaginable, Read This You can enjoy all of Bloomberg’s Weekend Edition online or in the app, where you can also listen to a selection of stories.

Tricky Trade-Offs            Every day, Americans open their refrigerators or turn on their dishwashers without fanfare. But a hidden problem looms: distorted power supplies. These “bad harmonics” — sudden surges or sags in electricity — can lead to sparks and even fires, and AI data centers may be a factor. More than 75% of highly distorted power readings in the US are within 50 miles of significant data center activity.                       Power Distortion       AI needs so much electricity that it’s making yours worse.        Read the Story                The pitfalls of progress are familiar on Indonesian islands that have been transformed into hubs for mining and processing nickel. The metal is essential to many electric car batteries, and one complex— the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park — employs more than 100,000 workers. But with that success has come a string of fatal accidents, as well as respiratory ailments in surrounding communities.                      The Dirty Price of Clean Cars       A deadly mining complex is powering the EV revolution.         Read the Story                Economic growth can be a powerful promise. For 40 years, China’s population experienced exceptional wealth gains, in unspoken exchange for minimal say in governance. But under Xi Jinping, those gains have slowed thanks to a real estate collapse, a trade war with the US and a crackdown on entrepreneurs. Now, Xi can’t count on prosperity to underpin support for Communist Party rule.                      ‘Are You Better Off?’       Asking Reagan’s question in Xi’s China.

The game, it turns out, is rigged. New federal data obtained by Bloomberg News reveal how thousands of companies  got an unfair advantage by helping themselves to extra lottery tickets.   Photo edited by Yuki Tanaka  A shadow fleet is transporting gas for Russia.

As insurers cut business in states like California and Florida, homeowners are often covered by state-created “last resort” programs. Those plans’ liabilities crossed $1 trillion 2022, but states have dodged a big question: How will they cover claims in the wake of a truly major catastrophe?   Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Roblox has a pedophile problem. Roblox was launched as a new frontier for education software, and over 40% of its 78 million daily active users are preteens.

While it’s too early to quantify the long-term health impacts, pharmacies, grocers, and doctor’s offices are all seeing evidence of change — even as high demand pushes some insurers and employers to stop covering the drugs.

Money managers are looking at ways to invest for a world growing older, one characterized by faster inflation, higher government health spending and bigger deficits. What we’re side-eying: Elon Musk’s pronatalism obsession. For the father of 12, global fertility rates are the defining crisis. It’s a take Musk supports with his money as well as his social posts.What we’re wearing: Nike Panda Dunks. Unfortunately, so is everyone else. The sneaker’s rise and fall is one example of how ex-CEO John Donahoe cost Nike market share and swagger. What we’re reading: Same as Ever: A Guide to What Never Changes. Two CEOs picked the book, which unpacks fundamentals of human behavior, for this year’s list of essential reading.

Fewer and fewer people, it turns out. Bike sales plummeted in the US after the financial crash, and have never really recovered.

New federal data obtained by Bloomberg News reveal how thousands of companies  got an unfair advantage by helping themselves to extra lottery tickets.   Photo edited by Yuki Tanaka  A shadow fleet is transporting gas for Russia.

As insurers cut business in states like California and Florida, homeowners are often covered by state-created “last resort” programs. Those plans’ liabilities crossed $1 trillion 2022, but states have dodged a big question: How will they cover claims in the wake of a truly major catastrophe?   Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Roblox has a pedophile problem. Roblox was launched as a new frontier for education software, and over 40% of its 78 million daily active users are preteens. But since 2018, police have arrested dozens of people for abusing victims they met on the site, and former employees say growth can take priority over child safety.   Illustration: Elliot Gray for Bloomberg              Ozempictown, USA         “We’re redneck enough to be fat, but  smart enough to do something about it.”     Mary Sansom A recently retired schoolteacher in Bowling Green, Kentucky     Roughly 4% of residents in Bowling Green have received prescriptions for weight-loss drugs in the past year, the highest concentration in the US. While it’s too early to quantify the long-term health impacts, pharmacies, grocers, and doctor’s offices are all seeing evidence of change — even as high demand pushes some insurers and employers to stop covering the drugs.

        <description>Evening Briefing: Americas  

      Bloomberg Evening Briefing Americas         View in browser                          Where the Magnificent Seven go, the rest usually follow. That was the case much of this year as Wall Street hit record after record. But alas that same pattern can play out in the red, too. Hoping for a so-called Santa Claus rally, investors instead found no batteries included amid Friday’s thin trading as the S&P 500 lost 1.1% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 1.4%. While every major industry succumbed to the slide, it was the seven technology megacaps that took it in the teeth. Still, with its limited trading and traditionally light volumes, next week may bring some unforeseen packages. Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers says he’s been fielding more inquiries than expected. “There are large accounts, pension funds and the like, who need to rebalance their holdings before year-end,” he said. —David E. Rovella            What You Need to Know Today            Both Chicago and the state of Illinois have weathered several high-profile corporate departures in recent years, ranging from Ken Griffin’s Wall Street giant Citadel, construction stalwart Caterpillar and even embattled planemaker Boeing. The city has been struggling of late to fill its coffers. Now Peak6 Investments isjoining the herd and transferring its global headquarters to Austin. The company, with a portfolio that’s ranged from early-stage businesses to professional sports teams, said the move will put its executive team closer to the bulk of its workers, a majority of whom are already in Texas.                For years, rates on government loans didn’t matter to student borrowers because pandemic-induced forbearance meant interest wasn’t accruing. There was also the promise of potential loan forgiveness as the Biden administration sought to attack that singular American scourge of massive educational debt. But borrowers have finally gotten the memo. With Republicans taking full control of the federal government and court decisions having blocked efforts to forgive loans, it may be time to refinance. Private lenders say they’re seeing an uptick in activity following the Nov. 5 election. And after multiple cuts to interest rates, those weighed down by student debt may be able to lock in a much lower monthly payment.                  After a surprise offensive earlier this year, Ukraine’s forces have lost about half the territory seized in Russia’s Kursk region and may lose the rest in a matter of months, according to US officials, potentially depriving Kyiv of important leverage for any ceasefire talks. Ukraine’s military is already grappling with a lack of manpower and uncertainty about the future flow of supplies (given the return of a Vladimir Putin-admiring Donald Trump) as it struggles to fend off Russian advances in its east. In Kursk, Ukrainian troops are also facing off against about 12,000 North Korean troops reinforcing the Russians. But despite a possible Ukrainian retreat, the incursion has already imposed a heavy cost on Russia and its ally.                Homelessness in the US soared to its highest level since the federal government began keeping track nearly 20 years ago, driven by high rents and a lack of affordable options but also a crush of migrants claiming asylum at the US border with Mexico. Almost 772,000 people were counted as homeless on a single night in January 2024, an 18% increase over the prior year’s count, which itself set a record for the number of homeless people nationwide. The count includes more than 80,000 families with children, whose ranks grew dramatically—up 39% over 2023.  New York City police arrest protesters and remove homeless residents and their belongings during a raid on an encampment in Manhattan’s East Village in 2022.  Photographer: Anadolu Agency                 Dory Hux was a competitive middle-school soccer player from North Carolina with vigilant parents who started putting sunscreen on their freckle-faced son at a young age. It was easy for them to apply thanks to the propellant used in spray-on sunscreens. But they had no way of knowing the gas, derived from fossil fuel, contaminated the sunscreen with benzene, a potent carcinogen. Hux died in 2021, just months before the sunscreen’s maker would recall the product. And while the risks associated with some household items have been known, an emerging field of research has uncovered a minefield of poisons among the US consumer goods in your medicine cabinet, closets and cupboards—from sunscreen to tampons and antiperspirants.                In a world where authoritarianism and war are on the march, the fatalists have retreated, shrugging their shoulders in the knowledge that the climate crisis will probably moot everything else. And 2024 was certainly their year. The past 12 months have seen a steady drumbeat of unsuccessful climate negotiations where nations couldn’t put long-term survival ahead of short-term benefit. Talks to halt plastic pollution, protect biodiversity and end desertification all failed. A deal at the COP29 summit left developing nations furious with the amount of money agreed upon to help them battle global warming—and the accord even avoided mentioning the need to move away from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, humanity is burning more of those atmosphere-warming fossil fuels than ever with efforts to dig more out of the ground accelerating. Here’s how humanity spent yet another year not solving the problem that scientists warn could lead it its extinction.                Artificial intelligence data centers are multiplying across the US, and they’re sucking up huge amounts of power. Now, new evidence shows they may be distorting the normal flow of electricity for millions of Americans. An exclusive Bloomberg analysis tied to readings from about 770,000 home sensors shows more than three-quarters of highly-distorted power readings across the country are within 50 miles of significant AI data center activity. The result can be what’s called “bad harmonics,” and it’s not only bad for everything in your house that uses electricity, but also America’s outdated and increasingly fragile power grid.   A power substation near a the LC1 CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia.

At Bloomberg Pursuits, we have a long wishlist of places we want to see next year. Some are all about the jaw-dropping landscapes or delicious foods, others entirely about immersion in different cultures. Here are five of our top picks, and  maybe yours as well.
