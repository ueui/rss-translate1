China is Rapidly Expanding Nuclear Forces, Says Pentagon

 




 




 

















China has increased its arsenal of operational nuclear warheads to 600 from 500 in just a year, as the People’s Liberation Army continues a rapid expansion of its forces, according to the US defence department. In its annual “China Military Power Report”, the Pentagon said the PLA had expanded its arsenal by 20 per cent in the 12 months from mid-2023 and was on track to have 1,000 operational warheads by 2030.

US Warns Russia May Accept North Korea as Nuclear Weapons State

 


 




 




















The U.S. warned on Wednesday that Russia appears close to accepting North Korea as a nuclear weapons state amid deepening military cooperation between the allies, despite previously voting to sanction Pyongyang over its nuclear development. “Alarmingly, we assess that Russia may be close to accepting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, reversing Moscow’s decades-long commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a U.N. Security Council (UNSC) meeting to discuss DPRK support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She added that Moscow will likely become even more reluctant to criticize Pyongyang’s nuclear development and “further obstruct passage of sanctions or resolutions condemning North Korea’s destabilizing behavior.”

South Korea to Set Roadmap in Case Trump Reopens North Korea Nuclear Talks

 


 




 





















South Korea's foreign minister said on Wednesday he was devising a roadmap to prepare for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's potential reopening of nuclear talks with North Korea, conceding Seoul's political turmoil had disrupted ties with Trump's team...

Trump Team Weighs Options, Including Airstrikes, to Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program

 


 




 




















President-elect Donald Trump is weighing options for stopping Iran from being able to build a nuclear weapon, including the possibility of preventive airstrikes, a move that would break with the longstanding policy of containing Tehran with diplomacy and sanctions.The military-strike option against nuclear facilities is now under more serious review by some members of his transition team, who are weighing the fall of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad—Tehran’s ally—in Syria, the future of U.S. troops in the region, and Israel’s decimation of regime proxy militias Hezbollah and Hamas.

New EU Renewable Energy Target Faces Nuclear Roadblock

 


 




 





















European Union plans for a new renewable energy goal hit early resistance on Monday from pro-nuclear governments, who indicated they would not back a goal that excludes atomic energy. The EU's 27 member countries have opposing views on nuclear power, and political disputes over the energy source have delayed recent EU measures to address high energy prices and drive Europe's transition to low-carbon energy sources…Plans to set an EU renewable energy target for 2040 have stirred tensions again, after the European Commission this month made the goal a surprise addition to the brief, opens new tab of new EU energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

Should the President Have Nuclear Sole Authority? We Asked 530 Incoming Congress Members

 


 




 





















Times Opinion last month surveyed members of the incoming 119th Congress about how they felt about this constitutional contradiction. We sent a short list of questions to all 530 voting members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives who are expected to serve in the new Congress seated in January. You can read our questions in full below. The main insight from the answers we received: If there is a widespread urgency or willingness in Congress to cooperate on bills that create safeguards around nuclear war, it was not apparent.

Russia Sells Out of Vast Kazakh Uranium Deposits to China

 


 




 





















Kazakhstan's nuclear resources company Kazatomprom said on Tuesday that Russia's Rosatom was selling its stakes in some uranium deposits which the two groups had been developing together to Chinese-owned companies. Kazatomprom, listed in London and Kazakhstan, is the world's largest producer of uranium and has the largest reserve base. It accounted for 20% of global primary uranium production in 2023, but lacks its own uranium processing capacity. Rosatom used to have stakes in 6 of 14 Kazatomprom's deposits, receivinga share of the output in a deal that complicated the Kazakh firm's sales to the West.

Wargaming Nuclear Deterrence and Its Failures in a U.S.–China Conflict over Taiwan

 


 




 





















This study examines nuclear dynamics in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a war that the authors hope will never occur. What creates the greatest pressure for nuclear weapons use in such a conflict? What happens if nuclear weapons are used? To answer these questions, the CSIS-MIT team modified its existing U.S.-China wargame to include nuclear weapons and ran it 15 times.

Security Council (UNSC) meeting to discuss DPRK support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She added that Moscow will likely become even more reluctant to criticize Pyongyang’s nuclear development and “further obstruct passage of sanctions or resolutions condemning North Korea’s destabilizing behavior.”

US Warns Russia May Accept North Korea as Nuclear Weapons State

 


 




 




















The U.S. warned on Wednesday that Russia appears close to accepting North Korea as a nuclear weapons state amid deepening military cooperation between the allies, despite previously voting to sanction Pyongyang over its nuclear development. “Alarmingly, we assess that Russia may be close to accepting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, reversing Moscow’s decades-long commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a U.N. Security Council (UNSC) meeting to discuss DPRK support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She added that Moscow will likely become even more reluctant to criticize Pyongyang’s nuclear development and “further obstruct passage of sanctions or resolutions condemning North Korea’s destabilizing behavior.”

Trump Team Weighs Options, Including Airstrikes, to Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program

 


 




 




















President-elect Donald Trump is weighing options for stopping Iran from being able to build a nuclear weapon, including the possibility of preventive airstrikes, a move that would break with the longstanding policy of containing Tehran with diplomacy and sanctions.The military-strike option against nuclear facilities is now under more serious review by some members of his transition team, who are weighing the fall of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad—Tehran’s ally—in Syria, the future of U.S. troops in the region, and Israel’s decimation of regime proxy militias Hezbollah and Hamas.

New EU Renewable Energy Target Faces Nuclear Roadblock

 


 




 





















European Union plans for a new renewable energy goal hit early resistance on Monday from pro-nuclear governments, who indicated they would not back a goal that excludes atomic energy. The EU's 27 member countries have opposing views on nuclear power, and political disputes over the energy source have delayed recent EU measures to address high energy prices and drive Europe's transition to low-carbon energy sources…Plans to set an EU renewable energy target for 2040 have stirred tensions again, after the European Commission this month made the goal a surprise addition to the brief, opens new tab of new EU energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

You can read our questions in full below. The main insight from the answers we received: If there is a widespread urgency or willingness in Congress to cooperate on bills that create safeguards around nuclear war, it was not apparent.

Russia Sells Out of Vast Kazakh Uranium Deposits to China

 


 




 





















Kazakhstan's nuclear resources company Kazatomprom said on Tuesday that Russia's Rosatom was selling its stakes in some uranium deposits which the two groups had been developing together to Chinese-owned companies. Kazatomprom, listed in London and Kazakhstan, is the world's largest producer of uranium and has the largest reserve base. It accounted for 20% of global primary uranium production in 2023, but lacks its own uranium processing capacity. Rosatom used to have stakes in 6 of 14 Kazatomprom's deposits, receivinga share of the output in a deal that complicated the Kazakh firm's sales to the West.
