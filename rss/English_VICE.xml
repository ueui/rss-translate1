        <description>Even after playing through plenty of other VR experiences, Sushi Ben sits high on the list of my most recommended.

        <description>Despite being a near-gaming masterpiece, Astro Bot is a heartfelt homage to 30 years of PlayStation history. Drumming up modern franchises and IPs not seen since 1996, it clearly shows that there’s still a lot of love for Sony’s iconic catalog. Earlier this year, Sony leadership claimed not to have enough original IP. Sony’s Studio […]

        <description>LG is snipping the power cord off its Blu-ray player business for good, as FlatpanelsHD reported late last week, and which you can see for yourself just by perusing LG’s 174 results when you search its website for the term “Blu-ray.” In the upper right-hand corner of each product page, you’ll see “discontinued” plastered.

        <link>https://www.vice.com/en/article/seth-ferranti-weed-outlaw-filmmaker-arrest-interview/</link>
        <description>Seth Ferranti calls himself “the Outlaw Filmmaker.” So it’s perhaps no surprise that he just got arrested with more than 400 lbs of cannabis in his truck. “They’re still acting like it’s the height of the ‘War On Drugs‘ years with marijuana,” he exclaims. “When is it going to stop?”  Seth has a big history […]

        <description>This might sound silly, but for the longest time, I hated VR because it was billed as “the thing that would replace consoles.” It’s human nature to be aggressively averse to change. Back then, VR was only a loose ambition that functioned horrifically most of the time. Big-time AAA publishers and developers wouldn’t touch the […]

        <description>Alt-indie-emo-whatever-rockers (including certain members of our own staff) rejoiced earlier this month when Turnover announced they would be embarking on a 2025 tour in celebration of the ten-year anniversary of their seminal/iconic/genre-bending/etc. album “Peripheral Vision.” (It’s just pop-punk with reverb, change my mind.) The Virginia natives announced just six dates in which the band would […]
