      <title>King Gizzard 与蜥蜴巫师：与摇滚界最大胆的乐队一起上路</title>
      <link>https://www.gq.com/story/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard</link>
      <description><![CDATA[2024 年，你如何在音乐界取得成功？首先：不要每年发行比你的铁杆粉丝能记住的更多的专辑。不要追逐你的每一个新想法（迷幻摇滚、电子音乐、交响乐团！），也不要让每张专辑听起来都与上一张不一样。不要鼓励粉丝盗版。最重要的是，不要给你的乐队起“King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard”这样的名字。GQ 搭上了澳大利亚六重奏乐队的便车，他们几乎做了所有你应该做的事情，但却成为了全球轰动的乐队。]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[从《魔法坏女巫》 (Wicked) 到《The Substance》 (当然) 到 Charli XCX 的《brat》，绿色不仅仅是一种流行的颜色，它还是一种不羁、直言不讳的女性气质的象征，定义了今年一些最伟大的流行文化时刻。]]></description>

        <link>https://www.gq.com/story/guy-pearce-gq-hype</link>
        <description>He’s always had a comic-book hero’s face. He stepped out of Australian soap operas and onto the Hollywood leading-man track.

The same thing he’s always done: seeking out the dark, risky territory where he feels most at home.</description>

        <title>King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard: On the Road With the Most Audacious Band In Rock</title>
        <link>https://www.gq.com/story/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard</link>
        <description>How do you make it in the music business in 2024? For starters: Don’t put out more albums every year than even your hardcore fans can keep track of. Don’t chase every new idea you have (psychedelic rock, electronics, symphony orchestras!) and make every album sound nothing like the last one. Don’t encourage fan bootlegging. And above all, don’t call your band something like “King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.” GQ hitches a ride with the Australian sextet who’ve become a worldwide sensation by doing just about everything except what you’re supposed to do.</description>

        <description>From Wicked to The Substance to (of course) Charli XCX’s brat, green wasn’t just a trendy shade—it was a symbol of the unruly, in-your-face femininity that defined some of the year's biggest pop-cultural moments.</description>
